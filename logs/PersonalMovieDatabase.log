Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.","poster_path":"\/rj9CMoZQVrbxYMTbdSBPzNepIvj.jpg"},{"popularity":0.6,"id":566990,"video":false,"vote_count":0,"vote_average":0,"title":"Gravity","release_date":"","original_language":"en","original_title":"Gravity","genre_ids":[],"backdrop_path":null,"adult":false,"overview":"Three boys power play with a gun.
