[INFO ] 2020-03-28 20:34:21.231 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - The cinematic kiss is probably one of the most archetypical images to be found in film history. It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

Along its three layers of emulsion, the film digs deep into the escapist colourised landscape of this time and asks for the material requirements, retentions and ideological continuities of the Agfacolor palette. The film sequences, projected in the former production line, dismantle not only themselves, but also our view accustomed to historicise. The film tries to realise, not only how it had been - in the darkrooms of the Agfa film factory - but also how it can be possible at all to face this reality today within film, in images and movements without a final or even conciliatory view of the past.

But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The Shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone-tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness of space. The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.

After asking various (dysfunctional) family members without success, she then asks Dr. Waxman of the Karl LaFong Foundation for Gravitational Research (motto: "heads in the clouds and feet on the ground"), who explains that gravity is caused by a substance named GR12. Unfortunately, the world is running out of GR12. The cartoon character Jiminy Gravity then explains (in song) how we can conserve gravity with such practices as sitting on the floor and carrying helium balloons.

[INFO ] 2020-03-28 20:44:49.235 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - The cinematic kiss is probably one of the most archetypical images to be found in film history. It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

[INFO ] 2020-03-28 20:44:49.237 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - Rainbow's Gravity is a cinematic study on the Agfacolor-Neu colour film stock made in Nazi Germany. Along its three layers of emulsion, the film digs deep into the escapist colourised landscape of this time and asks for the material requirements, retentions and ideological continuities of the Agfacolor palette. The film sequences, projected in the former production line, dismantle not only themselves, but also our view accustomed to historicise. The film tries to realise, not only how it had been - in the darkrooms of the Agfa film factory - but also how it can be possible at all to face this reality today within film, in images and movements without a final or even conciliatory view of the past.

After asking various (dysfunctional) family members without success, she then asks Dr. Waxman of the Karl LaFong Foundation for Gravitational Research (motto: "heads in the clouds and feet on the ground"), who explains that gravity is caused by a substance named GR12. Unfortunately, the world is running out of GR12. The cartoon character Jiminy Gravity then explains (in song) how we can conserve gravity with such practices as sitting on the floor and carrying helium balloons.

[INFO ] 2020-03-28 20:49:24.667 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - The cinematic kiss is probably one of the most archetypical images to be found in film history. It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

[INFO ] 2020-03-28 20:49:24.692 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - Rainbow's Gravity is a cinematic study on the Agfacolor-Neu colour film stock made in Nazi Germany. Along its three layers of emulsion, the film digs deep into the escapist colourised landscape of this time and asks for the material requirements, retentions and ideological continuities of the Agfacolor palette. The film sequences, projected in the former production line, dismantle not only themselves, but also our view accustomed to historicise. The film tries to realise, not only how it had been - in the darkrooms of the Agfa film factory - but also how it can be possible at all to face this reality today within film, in images and movements without a final or even conciliatory view of the past.

Unfortunately, the world is running out of GR12. The cartoon character Jiminy Gravity then explains (in song) how we can conserve gravity with such practices as sitting on the floor and carrying helium balloons.

[INFO ] 2020-03-28 20:51:47.946 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - The cinematic kiss is probably one of the most archetypical images to be found in film history. It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

[INFO ] 2020-03-28 20:51:47.951 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - Rainbow's Gravity is a cinematic study on the Agfacolor-Neu colour film stock made in Nazi Germany. Along its three layers of emulsion, the film digs deep into the escapist colourised landscape of this time and asks for the material requirements, retentions and ideological continuities of the Agfacolor palette. The film sequences, projected in the former production line, dismantle not only themselves, but also our view accustomed to historicise. The film tries to realise, not only how it had been - in the darkrooms of the Agfa film factory - but also how it can be possible at all to face this reality today within film, in images and movements without a final or even conciliatory view of the past.

But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The Shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone-tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness of space. The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.

After asking various (dysfunctional) family members without success, she then asks Dr. Waxman of the Karl LaFong Foundation for Gravitational Research (motto: "heads in the clouds and feet on the ground"), who explains that gravity is caused by a substance named GR12. Unfortunately, the world is running out of GR12. The cartoon character Jiminy Gravity then explains (in song) how we can conserve gravity with such practices as sitting on the floor and carrying helium balloons.

[INFO ] 2020-03-28 20:54:31.522 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - The cinematic kiss is probably one of the most archetypical images to be found in film history. It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

[INFO ] 2020-03-28 20:54:31.529 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - Rainbow's Gravity is a cinematic study on the Agfacolor-Neu colour film stock made in Nazi Germany. Along its three layers of emulsion, the film digs deep into the escapist colourised landscape of this time and asks for the material requirements, retentions and ideological continuities of the Agfacolor palette. The film sequences, projected in the former production line, dismantle not only themselves, but also our view accustomed to historicise. The film tries to realise, not only how it had been - in the darkrooms of the Agfa film factory - but also how it can be possible at all to face this reality today within film, in images and movements without a final or even conciliatory view of the past.

But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The Shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone-tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness of space. The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.

After asking various (dysfunctional) family members without success, she then asks Dr. Waxman of the Karl LaFong Foundation for Gravitational Research (motto: "heads in the clouds and feet on the ground"), who explains that gravity is caused by a substance named GR12. Unfortunately, the world is running out of GR12. The cartoon character Jiminy Gravity then explains (in song) how we can conserve gravity with such practices as sitting on the floor and carrying helium balloons.

[INFO ] 2020-03-28 20:56:53.315 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - The cinematic kiss is probably one of the most archetypical images to be found in film history. It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

[INFO ] 2020-03-28 20:56:53.319 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - Rainbow's Gravity is a cinematic study on the Agfacolor-Neu colour film stock made in Nazi Germany. Along its three layers of emulsion, the film digs deep into the escapist colourised landscape of this time and asks for the material requirements, retentions and ideological continuities of the Agfacolor palette. The film sequences, projected in the former production line, dismantle not only themselves, but also our view accustomed to historicise. The film tries to realise, not only how it had been - in the darkrooms of the Agfa film factory - but also how it can be possible at all to face this reality today within film, in images and movements without a final or even conciliatory view of the past.

After asking various (dysfunctional) family members without success, she then asks Dr. Waxman of the Karl LaFong Foundation for Gravitational Research (motto: "heads in the clouds and feet on the ground"), who explains that gravity is caused by a substance named GR12. Unfortunately, the world is running out of GR12. The cartoon character Jiminy Gravity then explains (in song) how we can conserve gravity with such practices as sitting on the floor and carrying helium balloons.

[INFO ] 2020-03-28 21:00:26.009 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - The cinematic kiss is probably one of the most archetypical images to be found in film history. It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

[INFO ] 2020-03-28 21:00:26.013 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - Rainbow's Gravity is a cinematic study on the Agfacolor-Neu colour film stock made in Nazi Germany. Along its three layers of emulsion, the film digs deep into the escapist colourised landscape of this time and asks for the material requirements, retentions and ideological continuities of the Agfacolor palette. The film sequences, projected in the former production line, dismantle not only themselves, but also our view accustomed to historicise. The film tries to realise, not only how it had been - in the darkrooms of the Agfa film factory - but also how it can be possible at all to face this reality today within film, in images and movements without a final or even conciliatory view of the past.

But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The Shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone-tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness of space. The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.

After asking various (dysfunctional) family members without success, she then asks Dr. Waxman of the Karl LaFong Foundation for Gravitational Research (motto: "heads in the clouds and feet on the ground"), who explains that gravity is caused by a substance named GR12. Unfortunately, the world is running out of GR12. The cartoon character Jiminy Gravity then explains (in song) how we can conserve gravity with such practices as sitting on the floor and carrying helium balloons.

[INFO ] 2020-03-28 21:05:16.677 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - The cinematic kiss is probably one of the most archetypical images to be found in film history. It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

[INFO ] 2020-03-28 21:05:16.694 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - Rainbow's Gravity is a cinematic study on the Agfacolor-Neu colour film stock made in Nazi Germany. Along its three layers of emulsion, the film digs deep into the escapist colourised landscape of this time and asks for the material requirements, retentions and ideological continuities of the Agfacolor palette. The film sequences, projected in the former production line, dismantle not only themselves, but also our view accustomed to historicise. The film tries to realise, not only how it had been - in the darkrooms of the Agfa film factory - but also how it can be possible at all to face this reality today within film, in images and movements without a final or even conciliatory view of the past.

But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The Shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone-tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness of space. The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.

After asking various (dysfunctional) family members without success, she then asks Dr. Waxman of the Karl LaFong Foundation for Gravitational Research (motto: "heads in the clouds and feet on the ground"), who explains that gravity is caused by a substance named GR12. Unfortunately, the world is running out of GR12. The cartoon character Jiminy Gravity then explains (in song) how we can conserve gravity with such practices as sitting on the floor and carrying helium balloons.

[INFO ] 2020-03-28 21:14:23.477 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - The cinematic kiss is probably one of the most archetypical images to be found in film history. It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

[INFO ] 2020-03-28 21:14:23.506 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - Rainbow's Gravity is a cinematic study on the Agfacolor-Neu colour film stock made in Nazi Germany. Along its three layers of emulsion, the film digs deep into the escapist colourised landscape of this time and asks for the material requirements, retentions and ideological continuities of the Agfacolor palette. The film sequences, projected in the former production line, dismantle not only themselves, but also our view accustomed to historicise. The film tries to realise, not only how it had been - in the darkrooms of the Agfa film factory - but also how it can be possible at all to face this reality today within film, in images and movements without a final or even conciliatory view of the past.

But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The Shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone-tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness of space. The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.

After asking various (dysfunctional) family members without success, she then asks Dr. Waxman of the Karl LaFong Foundation for Gravitational Research (motto: "heads in the clouds and feet on the ground"), who explains that gravity is caused by a substance named GR12. Unfortunately, the world is running out of GR12. The cartoon character Jiminy Gravity then explains (in song) how we can conserve gravity with such practices as sitting on the floor and carrying helium balloons.

[INFO ] 2020-03-28 21:17:50.448 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - The cinematic kiss is probably one of the most archetypical images to be found in film history. It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

[INFO ] 2020-03-28 21:17:50.449 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - Rainbow's Gravity is a cinematic study on the Agfacolor-Neu colour film stock made in Nazi Germany. Along its three layers of emulsion, the film digs deep into the escapist colourised landscape of this time and asks for the material requirements, retentions and ideological continuities of the Agfacolor palette. The film sequences, projected in the former production line, dismantle not only themselves, but also our view accustomed to historicise. The film tries to realise, not only how it had been - in the darkrooms of the Agfa film factory - but also how it can be possible at all to face this reality today within film, in images and movements without a final or even conciliatory view of the past.

[INFO ] 2020-03-28 21:31:10.586 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - The cinematic kiss is probably one of the most archetypical images to be found in film history. It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

Along its three layers of emulsion, the film digs deep into the escapist colourised landscape of this time and asks for the material requirements, retentions and ideological continuities of the Agfacolor palette. The film sequences, projected in the former production line, dismantle not only themselves, but also our view accustomed to historicise. The film tries to realise, not only how it had been - in the darkrooms of the Agfa film factory - but also how it can be possible at all to face this reality today within film, in images and movements without a final or even conciliatory view of the past.

But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The Shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone-tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness of space. The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.

After asking various (dysfunctional) family members without success, she then asks Dr. Waxman of the Karl LaFong Foundation for Gravitational Research (motto: "heads in the clouds and feet on the ground"), who explains that gravity is caused by a substance named GR12. Unfortunately, the world is running out of GR12. The cartoon character Jiminy Gravity then explains (in song) how we can conserve gravity with such practices as sitting on the floor and carrying helium balloons.

[INFO ] 2020-03-28 21:38:07.495 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - The cinematic kiss is probably one of the most archetypical images to be found in film history. It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

[INFO ] 2020-03-28 21:38:07.506 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - Rainbow's Gravity is a cinematic study on the Agfacolor-Neu colour film stock made in Nazi Germany. Along its three layers of emulsion, the film digs deep into the escapist colourised landscape of this time and asks for the material requirements, retentions and ideological continuities of the Agfacolor palette. The film sequences, projected in the former production line, dismantle not only themselves, but also our view accustomed to historicise. The film tries to realise, not only how it had been - in the darkrooms of the Agfa film factory - but also how it can be possible at all to face this reality today within film, in images and movements without a final or even conciliatory view of the past.

[INFO ] 2020-03-29 14:41:39.958 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - The cinematic kiss is probably one of the most archetypical images to be found in film history. It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

After asking various (dysfunctional) family members without success, she then asks Dr. Waxman of the Karl LaFong Foundation for Gravitational Research (motto: "heads in the clouds and feet on the ground"), who explains that gravity is caused by a substance named GR12. Unfortunately, the world is running out of GR12. The cartoon character Jiminy Gravity then explains (in song) how we can conserve gravity with such practices as sitting on the floor and carrying helium balloons.

[INFO ] 2020-03-29 14:41:39.967 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - Rainbow's Gravity is a cinematic study on the Agfacolor-Neu colour film stock made in Nazi Germany. Along its three layers of emulsion, the film digs deep into the escapist colourised landscape of this time and asks for the material requirements, retentions and ideological continuities of the Agfacolor palette. The film sequences, projected in the former production line, dismantle not only themselves, but also our view accustomed to historicise. The film tries to realise, not only how it had been - in the darkrooms of the Agfa film factory - but also how it can be possible at all to face this reality today within film, in images and movements without a final or even conciliatory view of the past.

But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The Shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone-tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness of space. The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.

[INFO ] 2020-03-29 14:42:43.278 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - The cinematic kiss is probably one of the most archetypical images to be found in film history. It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

After asking various (dysfunctional) family members without success, she then asks Dr. Waxman of the Karl LaFong Foundation for Gravitational Research (motto: "heads in the clouds and feet on the ground"), who explains that gravity is caused by a substance named GR12. Unfortunately, the world is running out of GR12. The cartoon character Jiminy Gravity then explains (in song) how we can conserve gravity with such practices as sitting on the floor and carrying helium balloons.

[INFO ] 2020-03-29 14:42:43.288 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - Rainbow's Gravity is a cinematic study on the Agfacolor-Neu colour film stock made in Nazi Germany. Along its three layers of emulsion, the film digs deep into the escapist colourised landscape of this time and asks for the material requirements, retentions and ideological continuities of the Agfacolor palette. The film sequences, projected in the former production line, dismantle not only themselves, but also our view accustomed to historicise. The film tries to realise, not only how it had been - in the darkrooms of the Agfa film factory - but also how it can be possible at all to face this reality today within film, in images and movements without a final or even conciliatory view of the past.

But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The Shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone-tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness of space. The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.

[INFO ] 2020-03-29 14:45:29.576 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - The cinematic kiss is probably one of the most archetypical images to be found in film history. It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

[INFO ] 2020-03-29 14:45:29.576 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - In this spoof of public-school educational films, young Mary Jane asks the question, "What is gravity?" After asking various (dysfunctional) family members without success, she then asks Dr. Waxman of the Karl LaFong Foundation for Gravitational Research (motto: "heads in the clouds and feet on the ground"), who explains that gravity is caused by a substance named GR12. Unfortunately, the world is running out of GR12. The cartoon character Jiminy Gravity then explains (in song) how we can conserve gravity with such practices as sitting on the floor and carrying helium balloons.

[INFO ] 2020-03-29 14:45:29.578 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - Rainbow's Gravity is a cinematic study on the Agfacolor-Neu colour film stock made in Nazi Germany. Along its three layers of emulsion, the film digs deep into the escapist colourised landscape of this time and asks for the material requirements, retentions and ideological continuities of the Agfacolor palette. The film sequences, projected in the former production line, dismantle not only themselves, but also our view accustomed to historicise. The film tries to realise, not only how it had been - in the darkrooms of the Agfa film factory - but also how it can be possible at all to face this reality today within film, in images and movements without a final or even conciliatory view of the past.

Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

Along its three layers of emulsion, the film digs deep into the escapist colourised landscape of this time and asks for the material requirements, retentions and ideological continuities of the Agfacolor palette. The film sequences, projected in the former production line, dismantle not only themselves, but also our view accustomed to historicise. The film tries to realise, not only how it had been - in the darkrooms of the Agfa film factory - but also how it can be possible at all to face this reality today within film, in images and movements without a final or even conciliatory view of the past.

But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The Shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone-tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness of space. The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.

[INFO ] 2020-03-29 15:03:17.339 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - The cinematic kiss is probably one of the most archetypical images to be found in film history. It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

[INFO ] 2020-03-29 15:13:54.089 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - The cinematic kiss is probably one of the most archetypical images to be found in film history. It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

After asking various (dysfunctional) family members without success, she then asks Dr. Waxman of the Karl LaFong Foundation for Gravitational Research (motto: "heads in the clouds and feet on the ground"), who explains that gravity is caused by a substance named GR12. Unfortunately, the world is running out of GR12. The cartoon character Jiminy Gravity then explains (in song) how we can conserve gravity with such practices as sitting on the floor and carrying helium balloons.

[INFO ] 2020-03-29 15:13:54.104 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - Rainbow's Gravity is a cinematic study on the Agfacolor-Neu colour film stock made in Nazi Germany. Along its three layers of emulsion, the film digs deep into the escapist colourised landscape of this time and asks for the material requirements, retentions and ideological continuities of the Agfacolor palette. The film sequences, projected in the former production line, dismantle not only themselves, but also our view accustomed to historicise. The film tries to realise, not only how it had been - in the darkrooms of the Agfa film factory - but also how it can be possible at all to face this reality today within film, in images and movements without a final or even conciliatory view of the past.

The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

Along its three layers of emulsion, the film digs deep into the escapist colourised landscape of this time and asks for the material requirements, retentions and ideological continuities of the Agfacolor palette. The film sequences, projected in the former production line, dismantle not only themselves, but also our view accustomed to historicise. The film tries to realise, not only how it had been - in the darkrooms of the Agfa film factory - but also how it can be possible at all to face this reality today within film, in images and movements without a final or even conciliatory view of the past.

But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The Shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone-tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness of space. The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.

[INFO ] 2020-03-29 17:36:10.788 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - The cinematic kiss is probably one of the most archetypical images to be found in film history. It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The Shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone-tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness of space. The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.

[INFO ] 2020-03-29 17:38:57.741 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - The cinematic kiss is probably one of the most archetypical images to be found in film history. It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The Shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone-tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness of space. The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.

[INFO ] 2020-03-29 17:52:03.310 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - The cinematic kiss is probably one of the most archetypical images to be found in film history. It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

[INFO ] 2020-03-29 17:52:03.312 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - In this spoof of public-school educational films, young Mary Jane asks the question, "What is gravity?" After asking various (dysfunctional) family members without success, she then asks Dr. Waxman of the Karl LaFong Foundation for Gravitational Research (motto: "heads in the clouds and feet on the ground"), who explains that gravity is caused by a substance named GR12. Unfortunately, the world is running out of GR12. The cartoon character Jiminy Gravity then explains (in song) how we can conserve gravity with such practices as sitting on the floor and carrying helium balloons.

[INFO ] 2020-03-29 17:52:03.318 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - Rainbow's Gravity is a cinematic study on the Agfacolor-Neu colour film stock made in Nazi Germany. Along its three layers of emulsion, the film digs deep into the escapist colourised landscape of this time and asks for the material requirements, retentions and ideological continuities of the Agfacolor palette. The film sequences, projected in the former production line, dismantle not only themselves, but also our view accustomed to historicise. The film tries to realise, not only how it had been - in the darkrooms of the Agfa film factory - but also how it can be possible at all to face this reality today within film, in images and movements without a final or even conciliatory view of the past.

Along its three layers of emulsion, the film digs deep into the escapist colourised landscape of this time and asks for the material requirements, retentions and ideological continuities of the Agfacolor palette. The film sequences, projected in the former production line, dismantle not only themselves, but also our view accustomed to historicise. The film tries to realise, not only how it had been - in the darkrooms of the Agfa film factory - but also how it can be possible at all to face this reality today within film, in images and movements without a final or even conciliatory view of the past.

But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The Shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone-tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness of space.

But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.

[INFO ] 2020-03-29 18:02:13.376 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - The cinematic kiss is probably one of the most archetypical images to be found in film history. It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.

[INFO ] 2020-03-29 18:07:24.728 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - The cinematic kiss is probably one of the most archetypical images to be found in film history. It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left.

It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

[INFO ] 2020-03-29 18:31:01.015 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - Rainbow's Gravity is a cinematic study on the Agfacolor-Neu colour film stock made in Nazi Germany. Along its three layers of emulsion, the film digs deep into the escapist colourised landscape of this time and asks for the material requirements, retentions and ideological continuities of the Agfacolor palette. The film sequences, projected in the former production line, dismantle not only themselves, but also our view accustomed to historicise. The film tries to realise, not only how it had been - in the darkrooms of the Agfa film factory - but also how it can be possible at all to face this reality today within film, in images and movements without a final or even conciliatory view of the past.

[INFO ] 2020-03-29 18:33:19.427 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - Rainbow's Gravity is a cinematic study on the Agfacolor-Neu colour film stock made in Nazi Germany. Along its three layers of emulsion, the film digs deep into the escapist colourised landscape of this time and asks for the material requirements, retentions and ideological continuities of the Agfacolor palette. The film sequences, projected in the former production line, dismantle not only themselves, but also our view accustomed to historicise. The film tries to realise, not only how it had been - in the darkrooms of the Agfa film factory - but also how it can be possible at all to face this reality today within film, in images and movements without a final or even conciliatory view of the past.

[INFO ] 2020-03-29 19:22:32.598 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - The cinematic kiss is probably one of the most archetypical images to be found in film history. It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

[INFO ] 2020-03-29 19:24:45.635 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - The cinematic kiss is probably one of the most archetypical images to be found in film history. It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

The Shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone-tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness of space.

But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.

It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

[INFO ] 2020-03-29 19:29:22.728 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - Rainbow's Gravity is a cinematic study on the Agfacolor-Neu colour film stock made in Nazi Germany. Along its three layers of emulsion, the film digs deep into the escapist colourised landscape of this time and asks for the material requirements, retentions and ideological continuities of the Agfacolor palette. The film sequences, projected in the former production line, dismantle not only themselves, but also our view accustomed to historicise. The film tries to realise, not only how it had been - in the darkrooms of the Agfa film factory - but also how it can be possible at all to face this reality today within film, in images and movements without a final or even conciliatory view of the past.

[INFO ] 2020-03-29 19:30:35.923 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - Rainbow's Gravity is a cinematic study on the Agfacolor-Neu colour film stock made in Nazi Germany. Along its three layers of emulsion, the film digs deep into the escapist colourised landscape of this time and asks for the material requirements, retentions and ideological continuities of the Agfacolor palette. The film sequences, projected in the former production line, dismantle not only themselves, but also our view accustomed to historicise. The film tries to realise, not only how it had been - in the darkrooms of the Agfa film factory - but also how it can be possible at all to face this reality today within film, in images and movements without a final or even conciliatory view of the past.

[INFO ] 2020-03-29 19:36:24.831 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - The cinematic kiss is probably one of the most archetypical images to be found in film history. It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

After asking various (dysfunctional) family members without success, she then asks Dr. Waxman of the Karl LaFong Foundation for Gravitational Research (motto: "heads in the clouds and feet on the ground"), who explains that gravity is caused by a substance named GR12. Unfortunately, the world is running out of GR12. The cartoon character Jiminy Gravity then explains (in song) how we can conserve gravity with such practices as sitting on the floor and carrying helium balloons.

[INFO ] 2020-03-29 19:44:17.627 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - The cinematic kiss is probably one of the most archetypical images to be found in film history. It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The Shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone-tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness of space. The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.

[INFO ] 2020-03-29 20:01:09.863 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - The cinematic kiss is probably one of the most archetypical images to be found in film history. It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

[INFO ] 2020-03-29 20:01:09.864 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - Rainbow's Gravity is a cinematic study on the Agfacolor-Neu colour film stock made in Nazi Germany. Along its three layers of emulsion, the film digs deep into the escapist colourised landscape of this time and asks for the material requirements, retentions and ideological continuities of the Agfacolor palette. The film sequences, projected in the former production line, dismantle not only themselves, but also our view accustomed to historicise. The film tries to realise, not only how it had been - in the darkrooms of the Agfa film factory - but also how it can be possible at all to face this reality today within film, in images and movements without a final or even conciliatory view of the past.

[INFO ] 2020-03-29 20:04:55.249 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - Rainbow's Gravity is a cinematic study on the Agfacolor-Neu colour film stock made in Nazi Germany. Along its three layers of emulsion, the film digs deep into the escapist colourised landscape of this time and asks for the material requirements, retentions and ideological continuities of the Agfacolor palette. The film sequences, projected in the former production line, dismantle not only themselves, but also our view accustomed to historicise. The film tries to realise, not only how it had been - in the darkrooms of the Agfa film factory - but also how it can be possible at all to face this reality today within film, in images and movements without a final or even conciliatory view of the past.

[INFO ] 2020-03-29 20:15:43.835 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - The cinematic kiss is probably one of the most archetypical images to be found in film history. It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

After asking various (dysfunctional) family members without success, she then asks Dr. Waxman of the Karl LaFong Foundation for Gravitational Research (motto: "heads in the clouds and feet on the ground"), who explains that gravity is caused by a substance named GR12. Unfortunately, the world is running out of GR12. The cartoon character Jiminy Gravity then explains (in song) how we can conserve gravity with such practices as sitting on the floor and carrying helium balloons.

She is watched over by Jorge, the cemetery caretaker, an illegal alien who is committed to the restoration of a classic '60 cadillac hearse. Shore is a dynamic, handsome, and brilliant young man who also happens to be homeless. After almost hitting Cassandra in his dilapidated VW bus, he becomes fascinated by the gothic cemetery waif and attempts to befriend her. A sequence of events results in Cass getting lost. Jorge and Shore flee the cemetery in a stolen hearse to find Cassandra before her abusive step-father does. All paths lead to Yermo - the site of a roadside diner and a feisty but compassionate transvestite waitress named Lola.

[INFO ] 2020-03-29 20:22:17.185 [main] MovieSearchDaoTest - The cinematic kiss is probably one of the most archetypical images to be found in film history. It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.

The film sequences, projected in the former production line, dismantle not only themselves, but also our view accustomed to historicise.

But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The Shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone-tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness of space. The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.
