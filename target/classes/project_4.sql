I didn\'t know what to expect but figured for a generic horror flick.  This had a good plot, a great flow and was a pleasure to watch.

Truth is there is just no replacing the original cast of the show but this is a decent attempt.

The main character\'s outfits in this film are probably the best thing about it.  Between being skin tight and goofy as it gets this guy is a champion.
