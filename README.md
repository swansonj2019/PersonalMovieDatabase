<b>Problem Statement</b>
<br/>

<p>It's easy to remember if you've seen the latest Star Wars film, but some movie buffs enjoy watching strange, obscure and sometimes downright awful movies.  Remembering if you've seen some of these movies, or what your thoughs on them years later would be nearly impossible.  Apps exist to track the different kinds of Beer someone has had and to rate how they felt about it, This app aims to do the same with Movies and Television shows.  Users would be able to begin building their own database of films they've watched, rate them and easily look up the results.</p>
